						<p align="justify">we describe our first authentication scheme that 
						  can be used with any IND-CPA secure encryption algorithm. 
						  An important assumption we make is that messages to be 
						  authenticated are no longer than a predefined length. This 
						  includes applications in which messages are of fixed length 
						  that is known a priori, such as RFID systems in which tags 
					    need to authenticate their identifiers, sensor nodes reporting events that belong to certain domain or measurements within 
					    a certain range, etc. The novelty of the proposed scheme is 
					    to utilize the encryption algorithm to deliver a random string 
					    and use it to reach the simplicity and efficiency of one-time 
					    pad authentication without the need to manage impractically 
					    long keys. Let N - 1 be an upper bound on the length, in bits, of 
					    exchanged messages. That is, messages to be authenticated 
					    can be no longer than (N - 1)-bit long. Choose p to be an 
					    N-bit long prime integer.</p>

					<h3>Efficient Authentication</h3>		
					<p>With today’s technology, many applications rely on the existence of small devices that can exchange information and form 
					  communication networks. In a significant portion of such applications, the confidentiality and integrity of the communicated messages 
					  are of particular interest. In this work, we propose two novel techniques for authenticating short encrypted messages that are directed 
					  to meet the requirements of mobile and pervasive applications. By taking advantage of the fact that the message to be authenticated 
					  must also be encrypted, we propose provably secure authentication codes that are more efficient than any message authentication 
					  code in the literature. The key idea behind the proposed techniques is to utilize the security that the encryption algorithm can provide 
				    to design more efficient authentication mechanisms, as opposed to using standalone authentication primitives.</p>

					<h3>PRESERVING the integrity of messages</h3>
					<img src="images/discussing.jpg" alt="" />
					<p>PRESERVING the integrity of messages exchanged over 
					  public channels is one of the classic goals in cryptography 
					  and the literature is rich with message authentication code 
					  (MAC) algorithms that are designed for the sole purpose of 
					  preserving message integrity. Based on their security, MACs 
					  can be either unconditionally or computationally secure. Unconditionally 
					  secure MACs provide message integrity against 
					  forgers with unlimited computational power. On the other 
					  hand, computationally secure MACs are only secure when 
				    forgers have limited computational power.</p>

			<h3>pervasive computing</h3>	
			<ul class="news">
				<li class="style3">
				  <div align="justify">There are three classes of standard message authentication 
				  codes (MACs) that can be used to preserve message integrity 
				  in mobile and pervasive computing. One can use a MAC 
				  based on block ciphers, a MAC based on cryptographic hash 
				  functions, or a MAC based on universal hash-function families. 
				  Since MACs based on universal hashing are known to be more 
				  computationally-efficient than MACs based on block ciphers 
				  and cryptographic hash function [34], we focus on comparing 
			    the proposed MAC to universal hash functions based MACs. In MACs based on universal hashing, two phases of computations 
			    are required: 1. a message compression phase using 
			    a universal hash function and, 2. a cryptographic phase in 
			    which the compressed image is processed with a cryptographic 
			    primitive (a block cipher or a cryptographic hash function). 
			    The compression phase is similar to the computation of 
			    equation.(4) of the proposed MAC (in fact, the proposed 
			    MAC of equation (4) is an instance of strongly universal hash 
			    functions). As opposed to standard universal hash functions
			    based MACs, however, there is no need to process the the 
			    result of equation.</div>
