				<h2>Abstract</h2>
				<p align="justify">With today’s technology, many applications rely on the existence of small devices that can exchange information and form 
				  communication networks. In a significant portion of such applications, the confidentiality and integrity of the communicated messages 
				  are of particular interest. In this work, we propose two novel techniques for authenticating short encrypted messages that are directed 
				  to meet the requirements of mobile and pervasive applications. By taking advantage of the fact that the message to be authenticated 
				  must also be encrypted, we propose provably secure authentication codes that are more efficient than any message authentication 
				  code in the literature. The key idea behind the proposed techniques is to utilize the security that the encryption algorithm can provide 
			    to design more efficient authentication mechanisms, as opposed to using standalone authentication primitives.</p>

				<h2>INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK</h2>
				<p align="justify">PRESERVING the integrity of messages exchanged over 
				  public channels is one of the classic goals in cryptography 
				  and the iterature is rich with message authentication code 
				  (MAC) algorithms that are designed for the sole purpose of 
				  preserving message integrity. Based on their security, MACs 
				  can be either unconditionally or computationally secure. Unconditionally 
				  secure MACs provide message integrity against 
				  forgers with unlimited computational power. On the other 
				  hand, computationally secure MACs are only secure when 
				  forgers have limited computational power. 
				  A popular class of unconditionally secure authentication is 
				  based on universal hash-function families, pioneered by Carter 
				  and Wegman [1]–[4]. Since then, the study of unconditionally 
				  secure message authentication based on universal hash 
				  functions has been attracting research attention, both from the 
				  design and analysis standpoints (see, e.g., [5]–[11]). The basic 
				  concept allowing for unconditional security is that the authentication 
				  key can only be used to authenticate a limited number 
				  of exchanged messages. Since the management of one-time 
				  keys is considered impractical in many applications, computationally 
				  secure MACs have become the method of choice for 
				  most real-life applications. In computationally secure MACs, 
				  keys can be used to authenticate an arbitrary number of 
				  messages. That is, after agreeing on a key, legitimate users  
				  can exchange an arbitrary number of authenticated messages 
				  with the same key. Depending on the main building block 
				  used to construct them, computationally secure MACs can 
				  be classified into three main categories: block cipher based,
